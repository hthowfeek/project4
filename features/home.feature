Feature: Standard View
As a user
I want to be able to view certain information
So I can have confidence in the system

Scenario: Do not see the default rails page
When I go to the home page
Then I should not see "You're riding Ruby on Rails!"
And I should not see "About your application's environment"
And I should not see "Create your database"
And I should see "Home" in the "title"
